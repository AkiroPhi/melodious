# Project Melodious

Tired of Discord's staff telling you to shut the fuck up about #DiscordUnbanQuackity?
Well, Project Melodious is **the** chat for you!

#### No bullshit, no biasing, fully opensource and can be hosted by anybody!

Written in Go, it is both fast and stable. Changes being made literally every 7-12 hours, it is growing fast and strong to be **a fully-featured Discord clone, without furries!**

Although it might seem like a shit idea since Discord is boasting a userbase of >150M people and counting, we are **free of furries**, which will probably attract more people.
