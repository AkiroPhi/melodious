# The problem is that to be able to use go get, one needs to put
# the repository in the $GOPATH. So for example if your gitlab domain
# is gitlab.com, and that your repository is namespace/project, and
# the default GOPATH being /go, then you'd need to have your
# repository in /go/src/gitlab.com/namespace/project
# Thus, making a symbolic link corrects this.
#before_script:
#  - mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/$(dirname $REPO_NAME)
#  - ln -svf $CI_PROJECT_DIR $GOPATH/src/$REPO_NAME
#  - cd $GOPATH/src/$REPO_NAME
